EDA on Zomato Dataset in SSMS

# Introduction

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard language to
interact with databases and a data analyst uses to manipulate and gain insights
from the data. For this project, I will try to process, and analyze the Zomato’s
Dataset from [Kaggle]
(<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabhar/zomato-restaurants-in-india?resource=download>)
